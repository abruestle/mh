<h2>Mech Piloting:</h2><br/>[Mechs] are small humanoid one-man machines exclusively piloted by characters with at least 1 [Rank] in [Mech Training]. A [Mech] can only be used by someone with [Mech Training].<br/><br/><br/><br/>A character with [Mech Training] can use any [Mech] that meets the following requirements:<br/><br/>The [Mech] has a maximum number of 3 [Mech Parts] plus 1 additional [Mech Part] for every 3 [Ranks] in [Mech Training].<br/><br/>The [Mech] has a [Mech Body] as one of its [Mech Parts].<br/><br/>Every [Mech Part] on the [Mech] has a maximum number of [Mech Points] spent less than or equal to 25*[Rank] of [Mech Training].<br/><br/><br/><br/>A character with at least 1 [Rank] in [Mech Training] can spend 24 hours working on the [Mech] to alter the [Mech] for their use. This can include detaching [Mech Parts], attaching new [Mech Parts], and allocating [Mech Points] to up to 25*[Rank] of [Mech Training] for each [Mech Part].<br/><br/>If a character has [Tech Training] higher than their [Mech Training], then they can use this skill in place of [Mech Training] to build a [Mech], even if they have no [Ranks] in [Mech Training] or the [Mech Points] of a part are higher than they can use.<br/><br/>In order to add a new [Mech Part], the [Mech Part] must be readily available to attach. A character cannot add [Mech Parts] that they don't already possess.
