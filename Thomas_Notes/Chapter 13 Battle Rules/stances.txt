Enter Stance Conditions: When a character performs the [Stealth] action, they enter the [Stealth Stance].

Enter Stance Effects: Unlike other [Stances], characters can be in the [Stealth Stance] at the same time as any other [Stance], so entering the [Stealth Stance] does not cause them to leave another [Stance].

Every other character starts [Aware] of the character when they are in the [Stealth Stance]. The other characters are all considered targets for all future.

Stance Effects: Targets are either [Aware] or [Unaware] of the character's location.

An [Aware] target knows the character's location and can target the character as normal.

If a target is not [Aware] of the character, then they are [Unaware] of the character. An [Unaware] target does not know the character's location and cannot target the character. The [Unaware] target cannot use any [Defensive Action] in response to the character's actions.

A character is in a target's [View Range] if they are located in the [Direction] the character is facing or up to 60 degrees off the [Direction] and their view of the character isn't obstructed. If the target's view is obstructed, then the character is not in [View Range]. This obstruction can be a physical object, heavy mist, or darkness.

If the character performs a [Movement Action] moving at least 5 feet, then they have a chance to turn [Aware] targets into [Unaware] targets. In order for this to occur, their [Movement Action] must include being outside of the target’s [View Range] at the end of the [Movement Action]. Each target that this applies to will roll their own [Defensive Charisma Roll]. However, the character using [Stealth] only needs to roll one [Offensive Charisma Roll].

Whenever a character performs any action with a [Subtlety Modifier], then all [Unaware] targets have a chance to become [Aware]. Each [Unaware] target will roll their own [Defensive Charisma Roll]. However, the character using [Stealth] only needs to roll one [Offensive Charisma Roll]. These targets will become [Unaware] of the character if the [Offensive Charisma Roll] is greater than or equal to their [Defensive Charisma Roll]. Using [Cast Spell], [Echo Spell], [Activate Spell], or [Elemental Riposte] with a [Spell] uses the [Subtlety Modifier] of the [Spell].

If the target is hit by a [Melee Attack], [Melee Combo Attack], or [Initiate Grapple] initiated by the caster, then the target immediately becomes [Aware] without the need for a roll.

If the target is hit by a [Gun Attack], [Aimed Attack], another [Verbal Action], [Activate Spell], or [Elemental Riposte], then the target’s [Defensive Charisma Roll] is increased by 10.

An [Aware] target can use the [Battle Communication] action to shout out the character's current location. If the [Aware] target performs this action, then all [Unaware] targets become [Aware].

Exit Stance Conditions: Unlike other [Stances], characters can be in the [Stealth Stance] at the same time as any other [Stance].

The character in the [Stealth Stance] can perform [Cancel Stance] at any time. If used in this manner, this only cancels the [Stealth Stance] and keeps the character in any other [Stance].
