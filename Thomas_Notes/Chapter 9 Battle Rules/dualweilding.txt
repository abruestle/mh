<h2>Dual Wielding:</h2>

If a character is wielding two weapons, then the character will calculate their new [Total Equipment Weight] accordingly, according to the weapon. These rules are found in the "Weight" section.

If a character is wielding two weapons, then the character will be able to perform two "Offensive Actions" in a single action block. In order to perform these "Offensive Actions", both of these "Offensive Actions" must be of the following types:

	"Melee Attack"

	"Melee Combo Attack"

	"Gun Attack"

	"Aimed Attack"

When wielding two weapons and using a shield, the additional action "Shield Block" can also be used by a "Shield", as long as the other weapon is using one of the aforementioned "Offensive Actions". Only one "Shield Block" can be performed per action block.

Various weapon modifiers only apply when attacking with that weapon. This includes:

	"To Hit Bonus"

	"Physical Damage Reduction Damage"

	"Mech Physical Damage Reduction Damage"

	"Strength Point Damage"

	"Speed Point Damage"

	"Range"

	"Short Range"

	"Medium Range"

	"Long Range"

	"Bullets Fired Per Shot"

The "Steady Shot Bonus" of a "Sniper Rifle" can not be used when two weapons are used.

When grappling, the wielder of two weapons with "Grapple Attack Bonus" and "Grapple Speed Damage Bonus" will only use the larger of the two bonuses.
